# URSNIF-Malware
URSNIF (Gozi) is a multifaceted malware family with an emphasis on information stealing that has been leveraged to exfiltrate sensitive data from targets, and has been particularly pervasive throughout 2016 and 2017. Since 2007, variants of the malware have been detected in Europe, Japan, and Australia, with more recent outbreaks in the US and UK.  The malware is most often used to target banks, but has also been used to attack email, cloud, commercial, and cryptocurrency trading websites, and is typically propagated by way of phishing campaigns utilizing tainted email attachments. Based on memory analysis, the malware also appears to have the capability to spread to external USB devices and hard drives.
