NanoCore
Whether the original intent of NanoCore was to be a free tool for intrusions or a paid piece of software to be used legitimately is unknown.

Whatever the case may be, all current versions of NanoCore appear to have all base plugins and functionality available without restriction. Between NanoCore's availability, the low $25 price point, and the free "cracked" versions found online, the use of NanoCore has spread quickly.
