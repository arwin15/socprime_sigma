# FlawedAmmyy-RAT-Detection.
Ammyy Admin is a popular remote access tool used by businesses and consumers to handle remote control and diagnostics on Microsoft Windows machines. However, leaked source code for Version 3 of Ammyy Admin has emerged as a Remote Access Trojan called FlawedAmmyy appearing in a variety of malicious campaigns. For infected individuals, this means that attackers potentially have complete access to their PCs, giving threat actors the ability to access a variety of services, steal files and credentials, and much more.  We have seen FlawedAmmyy in both massive campaigns, potentially creating a large base of compromised computers, as well as targeted campaigns that create opportunities for actors to steal customer data, proprietary information, and more.
